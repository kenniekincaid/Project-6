<!-- # Project-6
 Static Node.js and Express Site -->


 <!--ABOUT THE PROJECT: In this project, I used server-side JavaScript to create a porfolio site which showcases the projects I've built so far in the TeamTreehouse TechDegree program. My goal is to Exceed Expectations with this submission. -->

 <!--CHANGES: I've plugged in some art on my About Me page, added a bit of glow to my Introduction text under my profile picture in addition to making that text white. I also added a white-grey gradient  background image to the body, an extra button on the Learn More tab for my reserved website that I'll soon be building, and I added an additional contact number. I opted to keep this project close to simple since some of my projects are colorful.
 
 I enjoyed this project a whole lot and can't believe where I am from day one! -->
